# Change Management Workflow

1. **Initiation** — Submit change request in ALM with description, justification, affected components, and preliminary risk assessment.
2. **Impact Analysis** — Engineering, QA/RA, cybersecurity, and clinical stakeholders assess safety, regulatory, and operational impact.
3. **CCB Review** — Change Control Board reviews analysis, assigns classification (minor/moderate/major), and approves or rejects.
4. **Implementation** — Development teams execute work under configuration management, following branching strategy and coding standards.
5. **Verification & Validation** — Required tests executed; results documented and linked to requirements and risks.
6. **Approval & Release** — QA/RA issues release authorization; deployment performed via controlled pipeline with signed artifacts.
7. **Post-Implementation Review** — Monitor metrics, log outcomes, update CAPA if necessary.

Electronic signatures and audit trails recorded in the eQMS to maintain Part 11 compliance.
