# Design Control Plan

Defines how design control requirements of 21 CFR 820.30 and ISO 13485 are implemented for the infusion platform.

## Phases

1. **Design Planning** — Establish development plan, responsibilities, review schedule.
2. **Design Inputs** — Capture user and regulatory requirements in ALM tool; reference `docs/architecture/requirements-overview.md`.
3. **Design Outputs** — Software architecture, detailed designs, code, verification protocols.
4. **Design Review** — Stage-gate reviews documented with minutes and actions.
5. **Design Verification** — Execute verification protocols in `validation/` and capture evidence.
6. **Design Validation** — Conduct clinical simulations and usability testing with representative users.
7. **Design Transfer** — Release to manufacturing/operations with configuration baselines.
8. **Design Changes** — Managed per `docs/change-control/continuous-change-control-plan.md`.

## Records

All design control records stored in eQMS; this plan summarizes scope and references supporting documents.
