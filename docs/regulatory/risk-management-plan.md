# Risk Management Plan

Aligned with ISO 14971 and integrated into the organization's quality management system.

## Scope

- Covers pump firmware, bedside gateway, backend services, ML components, and integration interfaces.
- Includes identification, evaluation, control, and monitoring of risks related to patient safety, data integrity, and cybersecurity.

## Process Summary

1. **Risk Analysis** — Perform preliminary hazard analysis and FMEA during design input phase.
2. **Risk Evaluation** — Determine risk acceptability using predefined severity/occurrence matrix approved by clinical leadership.
3. **Risk Control** — Implement mitigations (design, protective measures, information for safety) and verify effectiveness.
4. **Residual Risk Evaluation** — Present residual risk profile to clinical review board.
5. **Post-Market Surveillance** — Monitor field data (telemetry, CAPA, complaints) and update risk files accordingly.

## Roles

- Risk Manager (QA/RA) oversees plan execution.
- Engineering provides design mitigations and verification evidence.
- Clinical representatives assess clinical impact.
- Cybersecurity team addresses threat-related risks.

## Deliverables

- Hazard Analysis
- DFMEA/PFMEA
- Risk-Benefit Analysis
- Risk Management Report
- Risk Traceability Matrix

All risk documentation is controlled within the eQMS; this plan provides the framework for project execution.
