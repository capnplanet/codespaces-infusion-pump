# MAP Prediction Training Pipeline

Implements reproducible training and evaluation for the short-horizon MAP prediction and hypotension risk models. Pipelines align with the ML Lifecycle blueprint and produce artifacts suitable for regulatory review.

## Components

- `train.py` — Orchestrates data loading, feature engineering, model training, and MLflow logging.
- `configs/` — YAML configuration files defining datasets, hyperparameters, and acceptance thresholds.
- `notebooks/` — Exploratory analysis (kept under change control when promoted).

## Prerequisites

1. Approved access to de-identified retrospective ICU datasets.
2. Configured object storage (e.g., S3/MinIO) for artifacts.
3. MLflow tracking server endpoint under change control.

## Execution

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py --config configs/baseline.yaml
```

All runs must be registered via the PCCP governance process. Validation reports generated by the pipeline feed into `docs/change-control/ml-pccp.md` artefacts.
